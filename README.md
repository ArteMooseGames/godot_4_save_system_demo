# Godot 4 Save System Demo
 Demo of binary serialization save system in Godot 4.


# Overview
This is a binary serialization/deserialization game save system developed by drawing inspiration from the tutorials below. 
We had a lot of trouble finding a clear example of a moderately complex save system, so I [Aaron](https://github.com/ajsams) made this one!

At the bottom of this file you will also find an implementation of a non-binary save system just in case that helps you to understand how this one works.

This save system can be extended in various ways, including adding multiple save slots.
